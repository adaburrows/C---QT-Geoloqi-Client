C++/QT Geoloqi Client
=====================

This is very much beta code. It currently does the requests you ask, but prints the replies to stdout. Eventually, the responses will be sorted out and sent in their respective signals.

This lib requires the QJSON library, and bundles it in the source.

To Use
------

Copy the config_vars.h.template to config_vars.h and change the variables to what they should be. Compile the project. Run it. Watch it puke across your terminal!
